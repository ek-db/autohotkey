;#######THIS IS THE BEST SCRIPT I'VE EVER WRITTEN.#########

;And also one of the simplest. Basically, If you press the "explorer" key (F1) it will instantly:
; 1. Create an explorer window if one is not already running.
; 2. Open the LAST ACTIVE explorer window if Explorer is not already active
; 3. If you keep pressing the key, it will cycle through Explorer windows in the order they were last activated

;Programs like chrome are a little different. It will open Chrome if it's not already open,
;but when you keep pressing the button, it hits "CTRL TAB" to advance you forwards through your tabs.

;This is all significantly superior to switching between applications by CLICKING on them in the taskbar,
;and also very superior to using WIN 1, WIN 2, WIN 3 etc to switch between applications.

;You will want to tailor this script to launch your own most commonly used applications.
;You can use Window Spy (it comes with autohotkey) to figure out the ahk_exe and ahk_class of your applications.



;Applications used in this example:
;explorer
;chrome
;word


#IfWinActive 

F1::
IfWinNotExist, ahk_class CabinetWClass
	Run, explorer.exe
GroupAdd, explorers, ahk_class CabinetWClass
if WinActive("ahk_exe explorer.exe")
	GroupActivate, explorers, r
else
	WinActivate ahk_class CabinetWClass ;you have to use WinActivatebottom if you didn't create a window group.
Return


F2::
;Pelle showed me that if chrome was opened with this script, it becomes a blank screen, and cannot open unless you restart your computer. I have disabled the opening command for now.
; IfWinNotExist, ahk_class Chrome_WidgetWin_1
	; Run, chrome.exe
if WinActive("ahk_class Chrome_WidgetWin_1")
	Send ^{tab}
else
	WinActivate ahk_class Chrome_WidgetWin_1
Return


F3::
IfWinNotExist, ahk_class Notepad
	Run, notepad.exe
WinActivate ahk_class Notepad
